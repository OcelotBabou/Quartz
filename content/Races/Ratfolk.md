Emerging as the newest race to grace the lands of Staterum, the Ratfolk embody innovation, intellect, and an insatiable curiosity that knows no bounds. Yet, despite their prodigious talents and boundless potential, they face the harsh sting of prejudice from other races, who view them with a mixture of fear and disdain.

Short-lived but ever-vibrant, Ratfolk thrive in the chaos of their rapid expansionist societies. Their ramshackled cities, adorned with towering crooked buildings, stand as testaments to their ingenuity and resourcefulness. Within these labyrinthine streets, the cacophony of exploding experiments echoes through the air, a constant reminder of their relentless pursuit of knowledge and discovery.

As the mad scientists of the world, Ratfolk are driven by an insatiable thirst for understanding, pushing the boundaries of science and magic with reckless abandon. Their labs, scattered throughout their bustling cities, teem with activity as Ratfolk tinker and toil away, concocting alchemical elixirs, devising ingenious gadgets, and unravelling the mysteries of the universe.

Despite their societal advancements, Ratfolk remain misunderstood by many. Their frenetic energy and unorthodox methods often alienate them from their neighbours, leaving them to navigate a world fraught with suspicion and hostility. Yet, undeterred by the prejudices of others, Ratfolk press onward, fuelled by their boundless curiosity and unwavering determination to leave their mark on the world.​

In the face of adversity, Ratfolk stand united, drawing strength from their shared heritage and common purpose. They may be the newest arrivals to Staterum, but their presence is felt far and wide, leaving an indelible imprint on the tapestry of history and shaping the world in their image.

As the sun sets on their ramshackled cities, casting long shadows across the crooked streets, Ratfolk embrace the uncertainty of tomorrow with open arms. For in the swirling chaos of their bustling metropolises, they find solace in the pursuit of knowledge, the thrill of discovery, and the boundless possibilities that await them on the horizon.
