**Description:**
Inhabiting the frigid northern reaches of the world, the Inerva Harpies are the hardiest and most resilient of their kind. With their stocky build and thick plumage, they have adapted to withstand the freezing conditions of their icy homeland, using their feathers as insulation against the biting cold.

Living in close-knit communities, the Inerva Harpies form tight bonds with one another, relying on each other for survival in the harsh and unforgiving environment they call home. Though wary of strangers at first, once accepted into a clan, outsiders are welcomed with open wings and treated like family.

Adorned with feathers ranging from white to light blue, the Inerva Harpies are a striking sight against the backdrop of snow and ice. But it is their mastery of ice magic, known as Glacimancy, that truly sets them apart from other harpy tribes.

From a young age, Inerva Harpies are trained in the art of Glacimancy, honing their abilities to manipulate ice and frost with precision and skill. Much of their culture revolves around the practice and perfection of this ancient form of magic, which they use for everything from hunting and crafting to communication and defence.

In recent years, the Inerva Harpies have found themselves in high demand among other races seeking to harness their glacimancy abilities. Their talent for preserving food stores and transporting goods has made them invaluable allies to those in need of such services.

Despite their newfound prominence, the Inerva Harpies remain fiercely loyal to their own kind and to the traditions of their ancestors. They are a proud and resilient people, determined to protect their homeland and preserve their way of life for generations to come.

As the world of Staterum continues to change and evolve, the Inerva Harpies stand as a testament to the enduring strength and resilience of the harpy race. With their mastery of Glacimancy and their unwavering commitment to each other, they are poised to carve out their own destiny amidst the frozen wastes of the north.
