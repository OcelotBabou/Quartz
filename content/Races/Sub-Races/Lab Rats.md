**Description:**
Within the bustling cities of the Ratfolk, there exists a subset of individuals known as the Lab Rats, the vanguard of experimentation and innovation. These daring souls are driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a relentless desire to push the boundaries of science and magic.

With minds sharp as the finest blades, Lab Rats excel in the art of experimentation, delving fearlessly into the unknown and daring to ask questions that others dare not ponder. Their labs, hidden away in the labyrinthine depths of Ratfolk cities, hum with the energy of discovery as they toil tirelessly to unlock the secrets of the universe.

​Fearless pioneers of their craft, Lab Rats are unafraid to challenge convention and embrace the chaos of experimentation. They eagerly tinker with alchemical elixirs, devise ingenious gadgets, and conduct daring magical rituals, all in the name of furthering their understanding of the world around them. In the eyes of the Lab Rats, there are no limits to what can be achieved through experimentation. They stand as beacons of innovation and progress, daring the world to dream big and reach for the stars.
