### 1. **Overview**

The Ancients are the earliest of the true gods in Staterum, born directly from the chaotic energies of the pre-universe. They embody the raw, foundational aspects of the universe that predate the more structured existence brought forth by later gods. As such, they represent fundamental cosmic forces and the very building blocks of reality. 

In broader Staterum society, The Ancients are more myth than religion. They are often subjects of scholarly interest or literary works rather than objects of direct worship. Tales of The Ancients serve as reminders of the universe's vast, often incomprehensible nature and the origins of existence itself. They are also cautionary tales about the power and responsibility that come with such cosmic roles.

### 3. **Perspectives

**Elves**
In the world of Statera, the elves hold a unique theological perspective that centers around two brother Gods, Gahrian and Alache. The elves revere Gahrian and Alache as the original creators and the brothers who shaped the cosmos. These divine figures are viewed not merely as gods but as the fundamental architects of the world, whose interplay of light and dark crafted all of existence.

The elven society venerates these deities through two primary sub-races, each aligning with one of the divine brothers:

1. **The [[Tenebrim]] (Moon) Elves:** These elves worship Alache, the Moon God. They celebrate the protective qualities of darkness and the concept of the night as necessary for renewal and rest. For the Tenebrim Elves, Alache's darkness is not an absence but a canvas upon which existence can be redrawn and rejuvenated. Their rituals often occur at night or during new moons, emphasizing reflection and the unseen gifts of the dark.

2. **The [[Lux]] (Sun) Elves:** In contrast, the Lux Elves worship Gahrian, the Sun God. They embrace light as a symbol of revelation, growth, and abundance. Gahrian is seen as the bringer of life and the force that drives creation forward. Celebrations for Gahrian are marked by festivals of light, particularly during the summer solstice, where the power of the sun is at its peak.

Elves believe that all newer deities, whether categorized under the Old Gods or the New Gods, are either direct descendants of Gahrian and Alache or were created by them. This lineage and creative power place Gahrian and Alache at the pinnacle of the divine hierarchy, even above [[Statera]], the goddess of balance revered by many other races and cultures in Staterum. To the elves, the balance Statera represents is merely a consequence of the equilibrium between Gahrian’s light and Alache’s darkness.

**Church of Statera**
Unlike the elves, the [[Church of Statera]], recognizes that within the celestial hierarchy, Gahrian and Alache hold roles as the younger siblings of [[Dorna]] and [[Eris]], all of whom are considered the children of Statera. In the early eons, Statera directly controlled the alternation of day and night, embodying the light and the dark herself. However, as the world of Staterum evolved and complex issues arose that demanded her attention, she delegated these responsibilities to Gahrian and Alache.

The average adherent is likely aware of the existence of deities governing the day and night but may not know them by name or understand their origins. In the Church of Statera, references or acknowledgement of Gahrian and Alache are not common, reflecting the minimal role they have played in the mortal world. For those in the Church who do study these deities, Gahrian and Alache are respected as dutiful children who have taken up significant burdens to facilitate their mother’s greater focus on maintaining universal balance.

**The Dahri Empire**
In the [[Dahri Empire]], where religion takes a back seat to science and empirical understanding, the notions of deities like Gahrian and Alache are met with skepticism. The Empire, regards the stories of a Sun God and a Moon God as quaint artifacts of less enlightened societies.

To the Dahri, the idea that celestial bodies such as the sun and the moon are governed by divine entities is seen as a simplistic interpretation, a relic of ancient attempts to explain the natural world. These celestial bodies, in the Dahri view, are no more divine than the oceans or mountains. The scholars of the Dahri Empire teach that the sun and the moon are simply massive sources of light that follow predictable if not fully understood paths.
