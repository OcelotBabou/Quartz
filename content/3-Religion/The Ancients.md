### 1. **Overview**

The Ancients are the earliest of the true gods in Statera, born directly from the chaotic energies of the pre-universe. They embody the raw, foundational aspects of the universe that predate the more structured existence brought forth by later gods. As such, they represent fundamental cosmic forces and the very building blocks of reality. 

In broader Stateran society, The Ancients are more myth than religion. They are often subjects of scholarly interest or literary works rather than objects of direct worship. Tales of The Ancients serve as reminders of the universe's vast, often incomprehensible nature and the origins of existence itself. They are also cautionary tales about the power and responsibility that come with such cosmic roles.

### 3. **Perspectives

**Elves**
In the world of Statera, the elves hold a unique theological perspective that centers around two brother Gods, Gahrian and Alache. The elves revere Gahrian and Alache as the original creators and the brothers who shaped the cosmos. These divine figures are viewed not merely as gods but as the fundamental architects of the world, whose interplay of light and dark crafted all of existence.

The elven society venerates these deities through two primary sub-races, each aligning with one of the divine brothers:

1. **The Tenebrim (Moon) Elves:** These elves worship Alache, the Moon God. They celebrate the protective qualities of darkness and the concept of the night as necessary for renewal and rest. For the Tenebrim Elves, Alache's darkness is not an absence but a canvas upon which existence can be redrawn and rejuvenated. Their rituals often occur at night or during new moons, emphasizing reflection and the unseen gifts of the dark.

2. **The Lux (Sun) Elves:** In contrast, the Lux Elves worship Gahrian, the God of Light/Excess. They embrace light as a symbol of revelation, growth, and abundance. Gahrian is seen as the bringer of life and the force that drives creation forward. Celebrations for Gahrian are marked by festivals of light, particularly during the summer solstice, where the power of the sun is at its peak.

Elves believe that all newer deities, whether categorized under the Old Gods or the New Gods, are either direct descendants of Gahrian and Alache or were created by them. This lineage and creative power place Gahrian and Alache at the pinnacle of the divine hierarchy, even above Statera, the goddess of balance revered by many other races and cultures in Statera. To the elves, the balance Statera represents is merely a consequence of the equilibrium between Gahrian’s light and Alache’s darkness.
