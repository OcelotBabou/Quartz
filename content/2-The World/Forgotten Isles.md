### 1. **Overview**

The Forgotten Isles are two remote islands at the southern tip of Siar'Morrin that once thrummed with the bustling activity of merchant ships. These islands, Isla Saura and Isla Thera, are steeped in a rich history of commerce, conflict, and isolation, each taking a unique path in the wake of global changes brought about by the Age of Darkness (AoD).

### 3. **Description**

Both islands are characterized by lush tropical rainforests that teem with life, including many large and primal creatures. These beasts, some of them enormous and ferocious hunters, add an element of danger and wildness to the islands. The residents, whether they are the technologically adept miners of Isla Saura or the adapted pirates of Isla Thera, must navigate the challenges posed by these formidable creatures.

Cut off from the rest of the world when ocean travel became perilous during the Age of Darkness, the Forgotten Isles, similar in ecology but starkly different in culture and population, have been forced to forge their own paths forward. The residents of Isla Saura and Isla Thera, despite sharing a similar tropical environment, have developed distinct approaches to survival. On Isla Saura, the focus has turned towards advancing technology and strengthening defences to contend with the island's natural dangers. Meanwhile, Isla Thera's inhabitants, originally pirates reliant on raiding, have adapted to their isolated circumstances by reverting to a more primitive lifestyle that aligns closely with the raw nature of their surroundings.
