*[naw-dhuhn si-arh mor-in]*

Northern Siar'Morrin, a vast and diverse region that encompasses a wide range of landscapes, from the blistering desert sands of the west to the icy tundra of the north. However, it is the eastern reaches of the region that boast the greatest diversity, with temperate rainforests, rugged coastlines, and rolling plains all converging in a stunning tapestry of natural beauty.

To the west lies the treacherous [[Sceel wastelands]], a harsh and unforgiving expanse teeming with danger at every turn. Here, the land is crawling with [[Sceel]] and [[Orcs]], fierce creatures fighting to survive in these harsh lands. Only the constant vigilance of [[Fort Logos]] stands as a bulwark against the relentless tide of invaders, protecting the southern lands from the ever-present threat of invasion.

In stark contrast, the eastern coastline of Northern Siar'Morrin is a land of tempestuous seas and violent storms, where towering cliffs and rocky promontories jut defiantly from the churning waters below. Courageous sailors and fishermen brave the treacherous seas in search of bounty, their lives intertwined with the ebb and flow of the tides.

Amidst the rugged landscapes of the east, nomadic and tribalistic peoples eke out a living amidst the harsh conditions, their lives shaped by the unforgiving terrain and relentless elements. Hardy and resilient, these people possess a deep connection to the land, drawing strength from its wild beauty and untamed spirit.

Yet despite the myriad challenges that abound, Northern Siar'Morrin remains a land of boundless opportunity and untold adventure, where the spirit of exploration and discovery thrives amidst the untamed wilderness.
