### 3. **Description**

Agra Island is the fourth largest landmass in Staterum and a verdant jewel of natural splendour. Enveloped in fertile forests that transition from the lush, dense tropical rainforests in the north to the cooler, more temperate woodlands in the south, Agra Island is a testament to the rich biodiversity and vibrant ecosystems nurtured under the watchful eye of Alber, the Goddess of the untamed wilds.

Agra Island was shaped by divine intent, created as a sanctuary for Alber at a time when the spread of human civilizations began to encroach upon the natural world. Alber, one of the few gods who chose to remain actively present in Staterum, views this island as her sacred charge. Her presence is palpable throughout the island, from the whisper of the winds in the canopy to the murmur of the streams that crisscross the verdant landscape. She is deeply woven into the life of the island, ensuring that it remains a bastion of untamed nature amidst a world often marked by human influence.

Among the myriad inhabitants of Agra Island, the Harpies of Tribe Agra stand out as prominent figures. These harpies have evolved unique adaptations to their lush environment, developing a symbiotic relationship with the dense forests. Their settlements are built high in the treetops, constructed from the very materials that the woods provide, allowing them to live in harmony with the surrounding nature. The Harpies of Tribe Agra are known for their deep respect for the forest and its deity, Alber, and they serve as her aerial guardians, protecting the island’s sanctity from any who might threaten it.

The biodiversity of Agra Island is unparalleled, with countless species of flora and fauna that are found nowhere else in Staterum. The island's north-south expanse allows for a remarkable variety of life forms, each adapted to the specific conditions of the tropical and temperate zones. The island also hosts vibrant festivals and rituals, many of which honour Alber and reflect the inhabitants' deep environmental and spiritual connections. These celebrations often involve elaborate dances, songs, and offerings made from the bounty of the forest, and they reinforce the communal bonds among the island’s diverse species.

In modern times, Agra Island remains largely isolated from the broader geopolitical landscapes of Staterum, a deliberate choice that preserves its ecological and cultural integrity. This isolation is not just physical but also ideological, with both the divine and mortal inhabitants committed to maintaining the purity and wildness of Alber’s refuge.
