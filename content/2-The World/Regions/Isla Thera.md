### 1. **Overview**

Isla Thera, once a notorious haven for pirates, has undergone a profound transformation. Positioned strategically to intercept merchant vessels from its neighbor Isla Saura, it served as a bustling base for piracy. Today, however, the island tells a story of descent and adaptation, reduced from a den of thieves to little more than primitives, living as hunter gatherers.

### 2. **Geography**

Isla Thera is characterized by its rugged terrain, featuring dense tropical rainforests, towering volcanoes, and pristine rivers. This lush environment, once a backdrop for pirate activities, now supports the island's inhabitants in their more sustainable, nature-integrated lifestyle.

### 3. **History**

Historically, Isla Thera thrived on piracy, with pirates flocking to the island to capitalize on the lucrative trade routes of nearby Isla Saura. They established a formidable fort on the southern edge, launching countless raids on passing merchant ships. However, the Age of Darkness (AoD) brought a decline in sea travel and, consequently, pirate raids, leading to a significant shift in the island's way of life. Deprived of their main source of supplies and income, the pirates turned on each other, and any semblance of society crumbled. Those that survived the ensuing chaos now live primitive lives, fighting for survival every day.  

### 4. **Political Structure**

With the decline of piracy, the political structure of Isla Thera shifted from a loosely organized band of pirate crews to survival of the fittest. Although many formed into small tribes, there is no sign of any formal governance any more. The strong take what they want and the weak perish.  

### 5. **Economy**

The economy of Isla Thera has evolved from piracy to subsistence living, with the islanders now operating as hunter gatherers to survive.

### 6. **Culture and Society**

The societal fabric of Isla Thera is starkly utilitarian, shaped solely by the imperative of survival. Stripped of any cultural embellishments that typically enrich a community, the islandersâ€™ daily lives revolve around meeting basic needs.

### 7. **Military**

The military aspect of Isla Thera has significantly diminished since its piratical heyday. The inhabitants no longer maintain organized pirate fleets but instead focus on defending their community from potential threats using skills passed down from their forebears.
