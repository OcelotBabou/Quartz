### 1. **Overview**

In the icy North of Kair'Thear, lie the Chorkas Forest, a sprawling boreal wilderness, known for its dense coniferous trees and severe, frosty climate. Home of the [[Barbearian]], this land is far removed from the wider world, with its harsh conditions making it virtually uninhabitable for most of the year for the less hardy races.

### 2. **Geography**

The forest spans a vast area characterized by long, dark winters that cloak the land in snow and ice, creating a landscape that seems frozen in time. With the arrival of spring and summer, the forest bursts into life, showcasing a stark contrast between the cold desolation of winter and the vibrant fertility of the warmer months. The severe conditions and remote location contribute to its untouched and wild nature.

### 3. **History**

Chorkas Forest is the secluded home of the Barbearians, descendants of the Alberine tainted by [[Ormos]], the Vice of Rage. Banished here for their ancestors' sins, they have developed a unique culture adapted to the harsh environment. Historically isolated, their existence has been shaped by their need for penance and adaptation to the challenging conditions.

### 4. **Political Structure**

The forest lacks a centralized government; instead, it is loosely governed by the Barbearian clans, each overseen by tribal leaders. Their governance is deeply influenced by their need for survival and the traditional laws that have evolved from their unique historical and cultural circumstances.

### 5. **Economy**

Chorkas Forestâ€™s economy is primarily subsistence-based, with the Barbearians relying on hunting and gathering within the forest. During winter, life for the Barbearians slows to a near holt, relying on stored reserves and a sedentary lifestyle to see them through the worst. There is little in the way of trade or external economic interaction, due to the region's isolation and harsh living conditions.

### 6. **Culture and Society**

The culture in Chorkas Forest is heavily influenced by the Barbearians' need for atonement for their ancestral sins and the ongoing struggle against the influence of Ormos, the Vice of Rage. Their societal norms and traditions are built around rituals and ceremonies designed to ward off negative influences and seek redemption. These practices are deeply embedded in their daily lives, serving as constant reminders of their penitential existence.

### 7. **Military**

Given the isolation and the harsh conditions, the military aspect of Chorkas Forest is more about survival against the elements and wild beasts than about organized warfare. However, the Barbearians are formidable in their defense of the territory, with survival skills that make them adept at protecting their domain. Individually, Barbearians rank amongst the most formidable warriors in all Staterum.

### 10. **Current Issues and Future Prospects**

This deep-seated desire for redemption shapes much of their societal focus and collective aspirations. The Barbearians hold a profound hope to one day reconcile with the Alberine and reintegrate into their ancestral homelands in the Vahshi Forest. Such a reunion is seen as the ultimate absolution for their ancestors' sins and a restoration of their place within the broader Alberine community.
