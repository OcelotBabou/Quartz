### 1. **Overview**

Welcome to Amyna, a region renowned for housing the Paleomyna Wall, an architectural marvel and the largest single structure in the world. Stretching across the landscape, this immense wall forms a formidable defense line against the ancient and formidable trogs from the Anteanus Peninsula. The presence of the Paleomyna Wall has catalyzed the development of numerous cities and settlements along its length, evolving into bustling urban centers that cater to the needs of the soldiers who perpetually man the wall.

### 2. **Geography**

Amyna's geography is dramatically split by the Paleomyna Wall, creating distinct environments on either side. To the east lies the Anteanus Peninsula, a rugged and scarcely populated area characterized by steep cliffs that plummet into the surrounding ocean. The peninsula's landscape is predominantly limestone, marked by an intricate network of caves that have rarely been explored beyond cursory scouting missions from the wall.

On the safer western side of the Paleomyna Wall, the geography varies significantly along its extensive length. In the southern regions, extensive forests once stood, but much of this woodland has been cleared to maintain an unobstructed passage along the wall's length and to create open fields that enhance visibility and defensibility. Moving northward, the landscape transitions into open plains, which further give way to marshlands and fluvial plains. This area is dominated by the expansive delta of the River Serinara, where it meets the Sea of Calanthe. The delta region is a mix of fertile land and challenging marshes, providing both agricultural opportunities and natural defenses against movements from the north.

### 3. **History**

The history of the Paleomyna Wall dates back millennia, constructed as a monumental defense against the trogs from the Anteanus Peninsula. This massive structure was engineered not just as a physical barrier but as a symbol of enduring protection against the darkness lurking beyond. Initially manned by iron golems, these guardians were created through ancient means now lost to time, symbolizing the pinnacle of past defensive strategies.

During the Age of Darkness (AoD), the Paleomyna Wall faced its most significant threat when invading demons targeted it as a strategic point for conquest. Their major ploy was to tear down the wall and unleash the trogs onto the broader region, aiming to sow chaos and destruction. The valiant defense mounted by the inhabitants of Amyna, supported by the remnants of the golem guardians, prevented this catastrophic fate. However, the conflict took a tremendous toll on the wall's defenders and its infrastructure. Now with it's ancient guardians much diminished its reliance on mortal soldiers has increased significantly. 

### 4. **Political Structure**

Historically part of the larger realm of Birania, Amyna and its major cities—Troianos, Solway, Corbridge, Carlisle, and Tyne—declared independence to preserve ancient customs and improve administrative efficiency. This independence allows each city to govern itself with distinct laws and customs, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of the region. However, the cities unite under a common military command lead by Troianos, during times of war, demonstrating their cooperative spirit and strategic unity.

### 5. **Economy**

The economy of the Amyna region thrives significantly due to the presence of the Paleomyna Wall. The continuous need to man this massive fortification with a substantial number of soldiers has naturally led to the development of various settlements along its length. These settlements evolved in times past. from basic encampments to bustling urban centers, as the local populace capitalizes on the economic opportunities presented by the stationed military forces.

These cities and towns flourish by providing goods and services required by the military, ranging from food and lodging to weaponry and armor. The constant flow of wealth brought by the soldiers and the logistical needs of maintaining such a large defensive structure contribute heavily to the local economy. Over time, these settlements have diversified their economic activities. Markets have sprung up to cater not only to the needs of the soldiers but also to the growing number of civilians drawn to the region by its economic opportunities.

### 6. **Culture and Society**

In Amyna, the culture is deeply influenced by its longstanding military focus, with societal values centered around martial prowess and the demonstration of strength and skill. This warrior ethos is not only a matter of survival but has also given rise to unique traditions that underscore the region's combative nature. One such tradition is the trog hunt, a daring and often perilous expedition where warriors, either solo or in groups, venture east of the Paleomyna Wall into the Anteanus Peninsula. The objective is to hunt and slay as many trogs as possible before returning. These hunts serve as both a rite of passage and a means to maintain combat readiness, while also acting as a population control measure against the trogs.

Religion plays a significant role in reinforcing these cultural values, with the population predominantly venerating two deities: Kakurcia, the god of the hunt, and Riero, the god of war. These gods reflect the dual aspects of Amyna's society—respectively symbolizing strategic prowess and the raw courage needed in battle. Troianos, the capital, houses the largest temple dedicated to Riero, where significant religious ceremonies are conducted to seek his blessings for victory and protection. A macabre yet revered feature of this temple is the Temple of Skulls—a towering pyramid made entirely of trog skulls collected from the defense of the wall. This chilling monument not only serves as a testament to the martial victories of Amyna but also as a stark reminder of the continuous threat lurking just beyond the wall.

Conversely, cities like Carlisle and Tyne have a stronger cultural affinity to Kakurcia, emphasizing skills and strategies associated with hunting. Celebrations and festivals in these cities typically involve competitions and displays of hunting prowess, serving to both honor Kakurcia and to foster a sense of community and shared heritage.

During peacetime, the cities maintain their own local forces, but when threats arise, a unified command under the General of Troianos coordinates the region’s defenses. This system ensures that Amyna can rapidly respond to any incursion by the trogs, with the General overseeing strategies that leverage the wall’s defensive capabilities to the fullest.
