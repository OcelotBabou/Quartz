### 1. **Overview**

The Arctic Expanse, a vast and seemingly endless region of ice and snow, marks the northernmost reaches of Siar’Morrin. In this relentlessly harsh environment, where the air is perpetually crisp and the landscape a continuous expanse of white, reside the Iceborne. These hardy individuals have mastered glacimancy, a unique form of magic harnessing the intrinsic energies of ice and snow, enabling them to not only survive but also thrive under extreme conditions. From glacimancy, they sculpt shelters, craft weapons, and are imbued with magical properties to withstand the severe cold.

### 2. **Geography**

Spanning a vast area, the Arctic Expanse is defined by its endless ice fields and deep snows that reflect a striking, harsh beauty. The terrain is predominantly flat and open, broken only by occasional ridges and the dramatic ice formations crafted by the Iceborne. The severe climate dictates every aspect of life here, influencing the architectural and survival strategies of its inhabitants. The region's isolation is punctuated by the dazzling auroras that light up the sky, adding to its mystique and beauty.

### 3. **History**

Historically, the Iceborne of the Arctic Expanse lived in isolation, their communities concealed within the icy wilderness, far from the bustling centers of Eastern and Western Siar’Morrin. Their existence was largely unnoticed until the broader utility of glacimancy, particularly in food preservation for long journeys, was discovered. As glacimancers became essential in supporting economic activities between distant regions, particularly in ensuring the longevity of perishable goods during transit, the Iceborne found their skills in increasing demand, drawing them gradually into the economic and social folds of Siar’Morrin.

### 4. **Political Structure**

The Iceborne communities are loosely organized, with leadership typically held by the most skilled glacimancers. These leaders are not only revered for their magical abilities but also for their knowledge of survival in one of the harshest climates on the planet. While there is no centralized government, the Iceborne maintain a form of cooperative governance that revolves around mutual support and the shared responsibilities of ensuring the community's survival and prosperity.

### 5. **Economy**

The economy of the Arctic Expanse is intrinsically linked to glacimancy. The Iceborne have capitalized on their unique abilities to freeze and preserve food, making them invaluable to trade routes that traverse diverse and often warmer climates. This specialization has not only provided them with essential goods from other regions but also integrated them into the broader economic system of Siar’Morrin, fostering interdependence between the ice-covered north and the more temperate south.

### 6. **Culture and Society**

The cultural fabric of the Iceborne is deeply interwoven with their reverence for Ooscara, the goddess of blizzards and ice. The original settlers of the Arctic Expanse, exiles seeking refuge in the desolate ice fields, stumbled upon a mysterious shrine during their most desperate hour. Understanding the formidable power of the gods, they offered prayers to this unknown deity, hoping for salvation in a land that offered little but frost and solitude.

Ooscara, responding to their pleas, bestowed upon them the art of glacimancy, a gift that transformed their survival into if not thriving, at least a manageable existence. The Iceborne have since regarded her with a blend of deep respect and intrinsic fear, fully aware of her pivotal role in both nurturing and challenging their lives. Ooscara’s influence is seen in the shifting ice and the stark beauty of the frozen landscape—forces that shape their daily existence and their survival strategies.

The discovery of Ooscara and the subsequent pact formed at her ancient shrine have become foundational myths of the Iceborne culture. Their rituals and religious practices are designed to honor her and reaffirm their devotion. The specifics of these practices are a tight kept secret of the Iceborne, and although unsubstantiated, dark rumors' circle about these practices. 

These ceremonies are particularly significant during the winter solstice, a time that marks the deepest embrace of Oscara’s icy realm. Many Iceborne, even those employed as glacimancers far from their homeland, make it a priority to return to the Arctic Expanse for these pivotal celebrations. For those Iceborne who cannot journey back due to distance or duty, finding the nearest ice shrine to participate in solstice rituals is essential. These shrines, scattered across colder regions of Siar’Morrin, serve as conduits for their devotion. 

### 7. **Military**

Given their isolation and the natural barriers provided by their environment, the Iceborne have little need for a formal military. Their main form of defense is the extreme climate itself, which deters most would-be invaders. However, they are capable of using their glacimancy for defensive purposes, creating barriers and weapons from ice to protect their territory if needed.

### 8. **Notable Locations**

List and describe significant cities, landmarks, or mysterious places within the region. This can include capitals, cultural sites, and areas of particular danger or interest.

### 9. **Significant Characters**

Introduce key figures associated with the region, such as rulers, heroes, or villains. Include brief descriptions of their roles and impacts on the region.

### 10. **Current Issues and Future Prospects**

The Arctic Expanse and its inhabitants, the Iceborne, are at a crossroads between leveraging the opportunities their unique glacimancy skills provide and preserving the sanctity and secrecy of their practices. As glacimancy becomes increasingly valued across Siar’Morrin for its practical applications in preserving food and enhancing trade, the demand for Iceborne glacimancers has surged. This demand offers significant economic and social opportunities for the Iceborne, enabling them to integrate more profoundly with the broader world beyond their icy confines.

However, this exposure brings with it the challenge of protecting the deeper, sacred aspects of their magical practices. The rituals and teachings of Oscara are closely guarded secrets, held within the community and passed down through generations with great reverence. The foundational myths of their culture, particularly the discovery of Oscara and the pact made at her shrine, are intertwined with ceremonies that are both powerful and deeply personal.
