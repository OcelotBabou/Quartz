### 1. **Overview**

Nordholt, nestled between the Turgu River and the icy expanses of the north, is a region of stark seasonal contrasts. Known for its rugged landscapes and divided into four distinctive subregions—Vestrack, Hafjord, Grenvik, and Austfjell—each area has developed unique traditions to cope with the harsh environmental changes. During the fertile summer months, these lands bloom with agriculture, supporting their inhabitants as they stockpile reserves for winter. When winter arrives, it brings a blanket of snow, transforming Nordholt into a realm of survival, where the inhabitants either migrate south or bunker down to endure the cold with their summer provisions.

### 2. **Geography**

Nordholt's geography is profoundly influenced by the seasonal extremes, with its landscapes transforming dramatically from summer to winter. During the warmer months, the region is blessed with lush, fertile land, nourished by the nutrient-rich waters from the seasonal melting of the northern ice. This meltwater enriches the soil, fostering vibrant plant growth and providing excellent conditions for agriculture. The plains and valleys become verdant expanses, supporting the cultivation of a variety of crops and the grazing of large herds.

In contrast, winter transforms these same fertile lands into a stark landscape blanketed in snow. The once-thriving fields become frozen expanses, resembling white seas that stretch across the horizon. The severe drop in temperature and the covering of snow significantly alter the environment, challenging the inhabitants with a harsh, cold wilderness.

### 3. **History**

Historically, Nordholt served as a frontier for scientific exploration and experimentation, far removed from the conservative scrutiny of the Aegir Coast. It was here that cities of steam and iron once sprawled across the landscape, filled with scientists and engineers who delved into arcane projects that pushed the boundaries of knowledge and ethics. These workshop cities became hubs of radical innovation, exploring the deeper, often perilous mysteries of the world. Among those who worked in these experimental enclaves was the young wizard Raxenos, who later spark the downfall of these lands.

The unchecked progress and potential dangers emanating from these cities eventually led to a massive crusade by the Knights of FireOath, a militant order dedicated to purging heretical and dangerous practices. Their campaign scorched the land with fire, systematically destroying the workshop cities and purging the region of its avant-garde elements, shortly before the onset of the AoD. This fiery purge transformed Nordholt into a scarred land, marking the end of an era of industrial and arcane prosperity.

Today, Nordholt has transitioned dramatically from its industrial past. Now positioned on the cusp of habitable lands and bordering the frozen expanses, the region has become a rugged refuge where its people, far removed from their scientifically advanced predecessors, carve out a subsistence-based existence. The communities here have adapted to the stark contrasts between the fertile summers and the severe, snow-laden winters, developing a lifestyle deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature and the harsh realities of their environment.
