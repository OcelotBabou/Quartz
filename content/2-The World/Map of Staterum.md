Staterum, a sprawling tapestry of ancient wonders and untamed wilderness, unfurls its vast expanse beneath the watchful gaze of the deities responsible for its creation. Over countless millennia, this world has borne witness to the rise and fall of empires, the clash of titanic forces, and cataclysmic events that have reshaped the land itself.

Dominating the western horizon stands Siar’Morrin, a cradle of civilization where humanity first set foot upon the fertile soil of Staterum. Here, amidst the whispering forests and rolling hills, the gods once walked among mortals, their divine presence shaping the destiny of nations. Yet, even in the wake of their departure, echoes of their influence linger, woven into the fabric of every stone and tree.

To the east lies Kair’Thear, a land shrouded in the veils of darkness and despair. Scarred by the cataclysmic events of ages past, in the East much of this forsaken realm remains in thrall to the malevolent forces that once sought to sunder the very heavens. Demonic legions prowl its shadowed depths, their presence a constant reminder of the fragile balance between light and shadow. While the West struggles to rebuild its once mighty empires and purge the demonic threat from its lands once and for all.

Betwixt these two titanic landmasses, amidst the azure expanse of the boundless sea, rises Mount Olympus, a towering colossus whose summit pierces the heavens themselves. A beacon of divine power and celestial majesty, it stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of gods long departed.

Deep in the oceans of Staterum are countless islands, following the cataclysm communication was lost with most. Now they are a mystery far removed from the pressing threats found contained within Siar’Morrin and Kair’Thear.
