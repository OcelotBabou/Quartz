### 1. **Overview**

The Dragon Teeth Islands stand as a secluded archipelago within the expansive Periculosus Ocean, well away from the nearest shores of Staterum. Named for their jagged, dragon-like peaks, these islands offer a stunning yet formidable landscape of sharp mountains and active volcanoes. The islands serve as a sanctuary from mainland turmoil, largely inhabited by the harpies of Tribe Eilearian, who navigate the rugged terrains with ease, and the sea dwarves, who reside on their floating city, Nereid's Haven.

### 3. **Description**

Dragon Teeth Islands, a secluded archipelago nestled in the vast expanse of the Periculosus Ocean, far removed from the nearest shores of Staterum. These islands are a remote paradise, untouched by the turmoil that afflicts the mainland, offering a pristine sanctuary for those fortunate enough to call it home.

The Dragon Teeth Islands are named for their rugged, jagged outlines, which resemble the serrated jaws of a dragon. This unique geography includes sharp-peaked mountains and active volcanoes, creating a dramatic landscape that is both beautiful and formidable. The islands are predominantly inhabited by the harpies of Tribe Eilearian, who have adapted perfectly to this environment. With their ability to soar high above the rugged terrain, the harpies thrive here, their lives intricately linked to the sky and the sea.

In addition to the harpies, the sea dwarves have also found refuge among these islands, particularly aboard their floating city, known colloquially as "Nereid's Haven." This marvel of engineering and resilience has allowed them to weather the worst of the Age of Darkness ([[AoD]]) in relative isolation and bliss, disconnected from the chaos that unravelled much of the known world.

The largest of the Dragon Teeth Islands, Eilear Island, is renowned for its lush tropical forest and the largest volcano of the archipelago, Mt. Talonflame. This island serves as a vital hub for the inhabitants of the archipelago, supporting a diverse ecosystem that includes numerous unique species of flora and fauna, which contribute to the island's self-sufficiency and the inhabitants' quality of life.

Since the AoD, the Dragon Teeth Islands have remained almost entirely cut off from the outside world. The only contact with the mainland is through the long-flighted harpies of Tribe Eilearian, who occasionally venture beyond their isolated sanctuary. The natural barriers created by the ocean and the islands' treacherous surroundings have helped preserve their way of life, shielding them from external threats and allowing their cultures to flourish in seclusion.
