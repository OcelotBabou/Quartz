### 1. **Overview**

The Adventurers Guild stands as a beacon of opportunity and camaraderie in the world of Siar'Morrin. With its network of bases strategically positioned across the land, it serves as a hub for adventurers seeking employment and purpose. Tasked with handling missions and odd jobs of all kinds, the guild acts as a vital link between those in need and the capable souls willing to lend their skills.

### 2. **History**

Founded centuries ago, the Adventurers Guild was reborn in its current form after the turmoil of the Age of Darkness, by the legendary figure [[Iblis]]. Iblis, once a trusted servant to the deity Eris, was gifted a second chance at life, and used this opportunity to stablished the guild as a force for stability and order. The guild has since played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of Siar'Morrin. It has not only facilitated the matching of skilled individuals with essential jobs, but also served as a foundational pillar of law and order. By maintaining a network of adventurers ready to tackle the challenges of a rebuilding world, the guild has provided both hope and direct support to those struggling to recover. Its presence has helped to keep society stable and guided many who might otherwise have lost their way amid the chaos

### 3. **Leadership and Structure**

The Adventurers Guild is structured with a hierarchical yet flexible leadership system, headed by Iblis. Below him, the guild is divided into regional chapters, each overseen by a captain who manages local operations. These leaders are responsible for assigning missions, maintaining guild standards, and overseeing the training and support of guild members. Leadership positions within the guild are often filled through meritocratic means, emphasizing skill, experience, and dedication.

### 4. **Culture and Beliefs**

The culture within the Adventurers Guild is deeply influenced by the principles of law, order, and structured hierarchy. Although direct worship of Eris is not mandatory, the guild’s operations and ethical guidelines reflect his virtues. Members are expected to adhere to a strict code of conduct that emphasizes fairness, justice, and responsibility, principles that guide their actions and decisions.

The entry trials for new members are a fundamental aspect of the guild's culture, designed to assess not only physical prowess and skill but also integrity and moral alignment with the guild's core values. This vetting process reinforces the guild's reputation for reliability and trustworthiness, making it a respected institution across Siar'Morrin.

### 5. **Geographical Territory**

The Adventurers Guild operates across all of Siar'Morrin, except for the North-Western corner, the Ridgeback Mountains acting as a natural perimeter to their jurisdiction. A key aspect to their success are the guildhalls and outposts strategically placed in major cities and near significant geographical or historical sites. These locations serve as bases for launching expeditions, providing support to travelers, and facilitating trade and information exchange between different regions of the realm.

### 6. **Alliances and Rivalries**

- **New Birania**:
The guild is often closely linked to New Birania, with some speculating that the guild operates as a means for New Birania to spread its influence. Despite these rumors, the two maintain a healthy relationship and mutual respect.

- **The Shattered Kingdoms:**
Recently, the Adventurers Guild has intensified its efforts in the Shattered Kingdoms, a region marked by turmoil and fragmentation. These lands have become a focal point for the guild’s support, aimed at stabilizing the area and aiding in its reconstruction. Despite these efforts, not all local kingdoms view the guild’s presence favorably; some perceive their intervention as meddling, causing a mix of gratitude and resentment among the various factions within the Shattered Kingdoms.

- **Lone Wolf Pack Guild**:
The Adventurers Guild views the Lone Wolf Pack Guild (LWPG) as renegades and amateurs in the adventuring scene. However, they acknowledge the positive aspects of the LWPG and have thus far avoided direct intervention in their practices, maintaining a cautious but non-confrontational stance.
