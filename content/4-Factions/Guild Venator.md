- **The [[Ascended Church]]:**
his religious faction views Guild Venator with disdain, criticizing it for monopolizing jobs that could benefit the common folk. They regard the guild as elitist and a protector of what they perceive as the nefarious Tenebrim elves, further fueling their antagonism.

- **Lone Wolf Pack Guild**:
Viewed as undisciplined and unsophisticated by Guild Venator, the Lone Wolf Pack Guild is considered a lesser entity—a collection of brutes and wildmen. The guild sees them not as a serious competitor but rather as a nuisance that fails to uphold the same standards of hunting and professionalism.
