**Description:**
Burrowers are the sturdy backbone of Alberine society, known for their resilience and determination. With powerful builds and unwavering spirits, they often take on leadership roles within their communities, guiding their kin with wisdom and strength. Burrowers are adept at navigating the dense undergrowth of the jungle, using their strength and determination to carve out paths and clearings for their fellow Alberine. They are deeply connected to the earth and the natural world, drawing strength from the land itself.
