Harpies are among the oldest races in the realm of Staterum, born from the chaos of primordial conflicts between the envoys of the air elementals. Crafted originally as soldiers for these ancient wars, they bear the mark of their violent origins in their fierce and territorial nature.

Despite the passage of centuries, the bitter enmity that once defined the relationships between the harpy tribes still lingers for many. To prevent further bloodshed, the tribes were separated to different corners of the land, each bound to their own territory by a powerful curse. This curse tied them to the land they inhabited, ensuring that they could never stray far from their ancestral home.

With the departure of the old gods, the power of these curses has begun to wane, but their influence still holds sway over the harpies, shaping their traditions and beliefs. It is a strong tradition among the harpies to be returned to their homelands upon death, and they will go to great lengths to ensure that this eventuality is realized.

Despite their turbulent past, harpies have formed bonds with many of the races of Staterum. Their natural scouting prowess and aerial abilities make them invaluable allies, particularly in times of war or conflict. They are adept at navigating the skies and surveying the land below, providing vital intelligence and support to their allies on the ground.

​Yet, for all their strengths, harpies are often misunderstood and mistrusted by other races, viewed with suspicion for their aggressive tendencies and fierce independence. Nevertheless, those who take the time to understand them will find that harpies are fiercely loyal allies, bound by a deep sense of duty and honour to those they call friend.

​As the world of Staterum enters a new era of uncertainty and change, the harpies stand ready to play their part. Whether as scouts, warriors, or diplomats, they will continue to make their mark upon the world, forging new alliances and seeking to overcome the legacy of their tumultuous past.
