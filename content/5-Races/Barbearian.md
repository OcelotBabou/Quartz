Amidst the stark, icy expanse of the Chorkas Forest, the Barbearians endure, a race of formidable humanoid bears carved from the relentless cold and isolation. Each Barbearian bears the weight of their ancestry, with fur as thick as the snow-laden pines and eyes that gleam with a fierce inner fire. Their bodies are massive and muscular, adaptations forged by both the harsh climate and their tumultuous history.

Once kin to the Alberine, the Barbearians' lineage took a dark turn during an age-old conflict, now lost to the annals of time. In this desperate era, they turned to Ormos, the Vice of Rage, embracing his corrupting gifts to gain strength. This power, however, came at a great cost—their ability to control their own fury. Now, even in the silence of the frozen woods, they are prone to bouts of uncontrollable rage, a peril to friend and foe alike.

Isolated in the Chorkas Forest, far removed from the civilizations of the world, the Barbearians seek redemption for their ancestors' folly. Their society is one of atonement and strength, where every individual strives to overcome the rage within, hoping to one day cleanse their lineage of Ormos's foul taint. They dream of a future where they can reintegrate into Alberine society, returning to the fold as equals and leaving behind the shadows of their past.

In their isolation, the Barbearians have developed a unique culture centered around mastery and control. Warriors and shamans lead their communities, teaching the young to harness and temper their inner fire. These leaders are revered, not only for their prowess in battle but also for their ability to maintain calm in a race constantly on the brink of chaos.

As the Barbearians continue their quest for atonement, they remain a powerful, if volatile, people. Though their interactions with the outside world are rare, those who encounter them are met with either fierce loyalty or overwhelming fury. Yet, beneath their tumultuous exterior lies a deep-seated desire to reconnect with their roots and restore the honor of their race.

**Age:** Alberine mature faster than humans reaching adulthood in mid-teens, and typically have slightly shorter lives, rarely living to older than 80.

**Alignment:** Barbearians tend towards chaotic alignments due to their fierce and untamed nature. They value freedom and are not typically inclined towards law or evil.

**Size:** Barbearians are larger and bulkier than humans. Your size is Medium.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**ASI:** +2 Str, +1 Con

**Natural Claws:** You have natural claw attacks, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Rage of the Wild:** You can enter a rage similar to a barbarian's rage once per long rest. While raging, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make an unarmed melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

While raging this way, you must make a wisdom save (DC X) at the start of each of your turns. On a failed save you must target the nearest creature with your next attack. 

**Bear’s Roar:** You can use your action to unleash a terrifying roar. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you and is aware of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
