Amidst the verdant embrace of the dense jungles that cloak much of Kair'Thear, the Alberine thrive, a race of humanoid beings whose lives are intertwined with the untamed beauty of their natural surroundings. Each member of the Alberine race possesses features reminiscent of the diverse wildlife that populates their lush homeland.

Alberine are humanoid creatures with fur-covered bodies, clawed hands and feet, and keen senses honed by generations of living in the dense undergrowth of the jungle. Their fur comes in a variety of earthy tones, blending seamlessly with the verdant hues of their lush surroundings. Each Alberine bears markings unique to their individual ancestry, further connecting them to the rich tapestry of nature that surrounds them.

Within Alberine society, individuals often fulfill roles based on their subrace, each bringing unique talents and perspectives to their community. The Burrowers, known for their sturdy builds and tenacious spirits, often take on leadership roles, guiding their communities with wisdom and resilience. Scurriers, nimble and agile, serve as scouts and foragers, adept at navigating the dense foliage and uncovering hidden secrets within the jungle's depths. Meanwhile, the Streamrunners, with their affinity for water and boundless energy, excel as fishermen and merchants, traversing the rivers and streams that wind their way through the heart of the jungle.

In ages past, the Alberine were reclusive and isolationist, preferring the solitude of their jungle home to the bustling world beyond. However, in the current age, spurred by curiosity and a desire for connection, they have begun to venture beyond the confines of their verdant sanctuary, seeking to forge new alliances and explore the mysteries of the wider world. Despite their newfound openness, the Alberine remain deeply connected to nature, revering the goddess Alber as both their creator and protector, and honouring the natural world as sacred and divine.

As the Alberine venture forth into the world beyond their jungle home, they bring with them a rich tapestry of traditions, customs, and wisdom, rooted in their deep connection to the land and the creatures that call it home. With each step they take, they carry the spirit of Alber within them, guiding their path and shaping their destiny amidst the ever-changing rhythms of the natural world.
