**Description**: 
The Arctic Cia'an are a hardy and resilient su-brace that have ventured far north from their ancestral homeland, seeking opportunity in the frozen wilderness of Duine. Inhabiting the icy tundra and snow-covered expanses of this unforgiving land, they have adapted to thrive in the harshest of environments.

Distinctive for their thick fur, which ranges from pristine white to shades of pale grey and silver, the Arctic Cia'an are perfectly suited to the frigid temperatures of their new home. Their fur serves as insulation against the biting cold, allowing them to endure even the most extreme conditions with stoic resilience.

Physically imposing and formidable in stature, the Arctic Cia'an possess a primal strength and ferocity that sets them apart from their Timber brethren. Theirs is a harsh existence, where survival is earned through strength and cunning, and only the fittest among them can hope to endure.

In contrast to their more civilized counterparts, the Arctic Cia'an are known for their primitive and animalistic nature. They are fiercely territorial and fiercely loyal to their own kind, forming tight-knit packs that roam the frozen wastes in search of sustenance and prey.

Despite their savage demeanour, the Arctic Cia'an possess a deep and abiding spirituality, rooted in the ancient traditions and superstitions of their people. They have developed their own unique religion, worshipping the primal forces of nature and the spirits of the frozen wilderness.

To the Arctic Cia'an, the land itself is sacred, imbued with the power and wisdom of their ancestors. They pay homage to the spirits of the earth and sky, offering prayers and sacrifices in exchange for protection and guidance in their harsh and unforgiving world.

But amidst the brutal beauty of the frozen north, the Arctic Cia'an find strength and solace in their bond with the land and each other. They are a people forged in the crucible of adversity, shaped by the harsh realities of their environment, and bound together by a shared sense of purpose and survival.
