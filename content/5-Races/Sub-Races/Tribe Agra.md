**Description:**
The Agra Harpies, hailing from the forested island of Alblitus south of Siar Morrin, are renowned for their petite stature and vibrant plumage. Among all the harpy subraces, they are perhaps the most visually striking, their feathers displaying a kaleidoscope of colours that rival even the most resplendent of tropical birds.

​Despite their diminutive size, Agra Harpies possess an infectious charm and boundless energy that endears them to all who encounter them. They are known for their friendly demeanour and loquacious nature, their voices carrying through the dense foliage like a symphony of songbirds.

​Living in relative isolation on their forested island home, the Agra Harpies are arguably the most mysterious of their kind. They have had limited exposure to the other races of Staterum, preferring the company of their own kind and the natural wonders of their lush and verdant homeland.

​Yet, for all their insular nature, the Agra Harpies possess a deep curiosity about the world beyond their borders. They are eager to learn about other cultures and civilizations, and are always quick to welcome outsiders with open wings and warm hospitality.

​Despite their friendly demeanour, however, the Agra Harpies are not to be underestimated. They are fiercely protective of their homeland and will defend it with all the ferocity of a cornered beast if threatened. Their intimate knowledge of the forest and its secrets makes them formidable opponents, capable of striking swiftly and decisively when the need arises.

​As the world of Staterum teeters on the brink of change, the Agra Harpies stand ready to embrace whatever the future may hold. Though they may be small in stature, their hearts are as vast and boundless as the skies above, and their spirit as untamed as the wilds they call home.
