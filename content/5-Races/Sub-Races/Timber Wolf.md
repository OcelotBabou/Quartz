**ASI**: +1 Dex

**Wood born:** You are particularly familiar with forest regions and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to forest terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in forest terrain, you gain the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
- Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
- While in the forest terrain you have a base speed of 35ft, and advantage of stealth check to hide.

**Pack Hunter**: As a bonus action you can give yourself advantage on an attack if you have an ally within 5 feet of the target. You can use this ability an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. This ability resets on a long rest.

**Description**: 
The Timber Cia'an are born and bred within the ancient depths of Sabhaile Forest, the verdant heartland of their kind north of the Grand Rift. From the moment they draw their first breath, they are steeped in the mysteries of the dense, temperate woodlands that have been their ancestral home for generations.

These Cia'an are as much a part of the forest as the towering trees and winding streams that populate its vast expanse. Their fur, ranging from earthy browns to vibrant russets, blends seamlessly with the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy above. Their keen senses are finely attuned to the rhythms of the woodland, allowing them to move through the forest with unmatched grace and stealth.

As natural hunters, Timber Cia'an possess an instinctual understanding of the land and its inhabitants. They navigate the dense undergrowth with ease, tracking prey with a patience and precision honed over centuries of survival in the wild. From the smallest woodland creatures to the mightiest beasts that roam the forest depths, no quarry can evade the keen senses of these skilled hunters.

But it is not merely their prowess as hunters that sets the Timber Cia'an apart. They share a deep, spiritual connection to the land itself, a bond that transcends the physical realm and binds them to the very essence of Sabhaile Forest. They draw strength and sustenance from the earth beneath their feet, channelling its power to fuel their own innate abilities and instincts.

For the Timber Cia'an, the forest is not merely a home, but a sacred sanctuary that sustains and nurtures them in both body and soul. They are its guardians and its children, sworn to protect its secrets and preserve its natural beauty for generations to come.
