Cia'an, also known as wolf-folk, are believed to be the offspring of Fi-an and Madra, revered deities of the forests and the wild. They possess the form of anthropomorphic wolves, standing upright on powerful hind legs with fur ranging from shades of grey to deep black. Their keen eyes gleam with intelligence, reflecting their innate connection to the natural world.

These enigmatic beings dwell within the dense forests north of the Grand Rift, where they maintain a close bond with the Fiawnish, a human race native to the region. Cia'an live in tightly-knit tribes, guided by a strong sense of loyalty and kinship. Within their communities, they excel as hunters and trackers, honing their skills to perfection over generations. 

Despite their prowess, Cia'an are known to prefer isolation from the outside world, preferring the solitude of their woodland homes. However, circumstances sometimes force individuals to leave their tribes behind. Exiled or banished for various reasons, these wanderers embark on journeys that lead them far from their ancestral lands.

Many of these exiled Cia'an have found renown and success across the realm of Staterum. Their exceptional skills as hunters and trackers make them prized assets in a world fraught with danger and intrigue. Wealthy nobles and adventurers alike eagerly seek their services, offering lucrative rewards in exchange for their expertise.
