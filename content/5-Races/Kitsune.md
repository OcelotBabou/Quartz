In the far reaches of the East, nestled amidst the mist-shrouded forests of the South Kiar'Thear, dwell the enigmatic Kitsune. These cunning and elusive beings are steeped in a tumultuous history of conflict and exploitation by humans. Now, their numbers are few, and a Kitsune sighting has become so rare that some believe them to be extinct.

Cloaked in mystery and legend, the Kitsune are known for their reclusive nature and deep-seated distrust of humans. They prefer the solitude of their forested sanctuaries, where they weave intricate illusions and shape-shifting magics to conceal their true forms from prying eyes. Naturally imbued with magic, they are able to channel their power through their tails, which grow in number as they age, up to a maximum of nine.

​As the world of Staterum stands on the precipice of change, the Kitsune watch from the shadows, ever vigilant and ever wary of the encroaching tide of humanity. For in their ancient wisdom, they know that some secrets are best left undisturbed, and some mysteries are best left unsolved.
