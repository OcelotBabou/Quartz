Welcome to Staterum, a diverse and vibrant planet where a myriad of races coexist, each contributing to the rich cultural mosaic that defines this world. The inhabitants of Staterum range from the enigmatic and reclusive [[Kitsune]], steeped in their mystical traditions, to the innovative and ever-curious [[Ratfolk]], whose cities buzz with the constant hum of experimentation and discovery. Together with the more well know races like [[Elves]], [[dwarves]], [[goblins]] and many more, Staterum is melting pot of traditions, beliefs and ways of life.
