## Mythology and Worship

- **Creation Myth**: Agra, the youngest and only daughter of Talam, the Primordial of Earth, differs from her brothers in her origins. While her siblings were born out of necessity, to aid in shaping Staterum, Agra was born from an act of love, infused with the intrinsic power to foster and enrich the earth. In the early days of the world, she wandered freely, her touch turning barren landscapes into flourishing gardens and verdant fields. As humanity expanded and began to dominate the landscapes she had so tenderly nurtured, Agra found her spaces of tranquility increasingly encroached upon. Witnessing the changes and increasingly the disregard for the sanctity of nature, she chose to retreat. Her withdrawal led her to Periculosus Ocean, a place where she finally created a realm of her own.
- **Major Cults and Religious Practices**: Having removed herself from the mortal world so many millennia ago, her story has largely faded from memory. Now she is almost exclusively worshipped by [[Tribe Agra]] alongside Alber. 
- **Festivals**: N/A
- **Clergy and Temples**: A devote group of [[Harpies]] from Tribe Agra have dedicated themselves to the ongoing worship and veneration of Agra. However, this group is significantly outnumbered by the followers of Alber, whose more active participation in the world has garnered a larger following. Despite being few in number, the shrines to Agra provide powerful access to the earthen powers inherit within Agra.
