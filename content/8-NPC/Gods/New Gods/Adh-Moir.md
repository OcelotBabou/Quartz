The legend holds that while the coin is in one's possession, fortune smiles broadly upon them.

	- Dice of Fate: These mythical dice are said to have been used by Adh-Moir himself to determine the destinies of those bold enough to seek his intervention. Each roll is imbued with the power to alter paths dramatically, weaving fate with the whims of chance in accordance with Adh-Moir's mercurial will.

## Background

Adh-Moir, often seen as a trickster and a gambler among the gods, embodies the essence of chance and unpredictability. His origins are as mysterious as the shadows that border the realms of Staterum, and his birth is a testament to the clandestine adventures of his father, Dorna, beyond the known cosmos. This heritage makes Adh-Moir a bridge between the familiar world and the enigmatic vastness that lies beyond, infusing him with abilities that even other deities regard with a mix of admiration and caution.

Throughout the ages, Adh-Moir has played a pivotal role in the shaping of civilizations, not through direct intervention but through subtle manipulations and the serendipitous twists of fate that seem to follow his attention. His influence is found in the rise and fall of leaders, the sudden discovery of resources that shift the balance of power, and the unexpected outcomes of pivotal battles. Yet, for all his involvement in historical events, Adh-Moir remains a peripheral figure, often forgotten until fate takes a sudden turn, reminding mortals and gods alike of his potent presence.

Mortals who are aware of Adh-Moir's existence often seek him out for blessings of luck, though they do so at their peril, for his gifts are double-edged. The tales tell of countless adventurers who gained immense fortune through Adh-Moir's favor, only to lose everything to a single twist of fate. These stories serve as cautionary tales, emphasizing the transient nature of luck and the caprice of a god who plays with mortal lives as though they were pieces in a cosmic game of chance.

Scholars and theologians debate the morality of worshiping such a fickle deity, arguing whether Adh-Moir represents a necessary element of chaos in a world governed by order, or if he is merely a cosmic anomaly—one that delights in the upheaval of lives and nations.
