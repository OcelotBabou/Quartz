## Mythology and Worship

- **Creation Myth**: Paysius was born when Gahrian defeated Tefylion, one of the incorpreal deities that predated the universe, dragging his soul into the material plane. To give this soul form, he imbued it with the excess arrogance held within himself. Thus creating the fourth Vice of Excess. As with its siblings Paysius would go on to seek war with its counter part in the Vices of Void, leading to great destabilization in the universe. Eventually, recognizing the folly of their creations Gahrian and Alache would defeat the Vices and banish them to their separate planes.

- **Clergy and Temples**: Temples dedicated to Paysius appear grandiose and lavish to his worshippers, however, to outside viewers they appear as little more than hovels or rundown structures, with the lavish decorations being mere illusions or poorly executed facades. The grandeur perceived by the worshippers is a manifestation of their collective arrogance and delusion, blinding them to the true state of their surroundings. Ironically, this works greatly to their advantage however, as it makes it far more difficult to discover them.
