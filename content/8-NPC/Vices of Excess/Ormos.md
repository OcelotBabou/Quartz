## Mythology and Worship

- **Creation Myth**: 
	Originally, Ormos was counted among the New Gods, embodying the raw survival instincts and primal aspects of humanity—those of fight, flight, and the fierce will to live. He was revered as a protector and a patron of those facing the harshest conditions, where the line between life and death was thin, and only the fiercest instincts could ensure survival. 
	However, during a pivotal era marked by rapid advancements and transformation within the mortal realms, the Ascended Gods—deities representing the triumphs and innovations of humanity—began to see Ormos's primal nature as an impediment to their vision of progress and enlightenment. They believed that for humanity to evolve beyond its primitive roots, it must shed the raw and untamed aspects that Ormos represented.
	In a calculated move, the Ascended Gods betrayed Ormos, orchestrating circumstances that publicly undermined his importance and tainted his influence. Feeling abandoned and deceived, Ormos's sense of betrayal festered into a deep-seated rage. His despair and fury at being cast aside drove him away from the New Gods and into the darker corners of the divine realm, where he encountered the Vices.
	The Vices, recognizing his potential as a force of destruction and chaos, welcomed him with open arms. They fed his anger and nurtured his resentment, slowly twisting him into his current bestial form, far removed from his original divine aspect.

## Background

Ormos's origins lie among the New Gods, where he was initially revered as a guardian of primal survival instincts and the fierce will to live. Representing the raw, untamed aspects of humanity—fight, flight, and survival—Ormos was a crucial deity for those living on the edge of existence. His blessings were sought in times of dire need, where only the strongest instincts could ensure survival against the harshest conditions.

However, during a pivotal era marked by rapid advancements and transformation within the mortal realms, the Ascended Gods—representing human progress and innovation—began to view Ormos's primal nature as a hindrance. They believed that to evolve beyond their primitive roots, humanity needed to shed the raw and untamed aspects that Ormos embodied. Seeing him as a restraint on progress, the Ascended Gods orchestrated his betrayal, undermining his importance and influence.

Feeling abandoned and deceived, Ormos's sense of betrayal festered into deep-seated rage. This anger drove him away from the New Gods and into the darker corners of the divine realm, where he encountered the Vices. The Vices, recognizing his potential as a force of destruction and chaos, welcomed him with open arms. They nurtured his resentment and fury, gradually transforming him into a more bestial and demonic form, far removed from his original divine aspect. Embracing his new role, Ormos became the Vice of Rage, embodying not just the survival instincts of humanity but also its capacity for uncontrollable fury and destruction.

Ormos's influence is most notably seen in the corruption of the Barbearians, a once-proud kin of the Alberine. During an ancient conflict, the Barbearians turned to Ormos for strength, embracing his corrupting gifts to survive. This power came at a great cost—their ability to control their own fury. Now, even in the silence of the frozen woods, they are prone to bouts of uncontrollable rage, becoming a peril to both friend and foe alike.

Throughout history, Ormos's presence has been felt in all major wars in Staterum. On the battlefield, he amplifies chaos and violence, corrupting participants and stripping them of their humanity, leaving them as embodiments of pure rage. His influence has altered the course of countless conflicts, leading to prolonged battles and unnecessary bloodshed. Ormos's relentless drive to spread his domain of fury showcases the devastating impact of unchecked anger and the dark side of survival instincts.
