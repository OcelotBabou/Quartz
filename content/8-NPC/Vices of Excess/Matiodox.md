His pride grew unchecked, evolving into a consuming self-obsession that began to distort his duties and cloud his judgment. The pride that had once made Matiodox a paragon of beauty and confidence now morphed him into a symbol of vanity and self-absorption. Left with no other choice to prevent further corruption and the unsettling effects on his celestial domain, Gahrian was compelled to banish Matiodox. Cast out from the celestial realms, Matiodox's fall from grace was complete. His banishment marked his transformation into the vice of vanity, a cautionary tale of how even the most beloved can fall the furthest when consumed by their own pride.

Initially embodying the admiration for perfection and beauty, Matiodox's role was to reflect the splendor of his master, Gahrian.

His vanity grew as he compared himself to Chyntun, the embodiment of shame, fueling a rivalry that pushed Matiodox towards an ever-increasing self-obsession.

This transformation was not without consequence. As his pride distorted his duties and marred his judgment, it led to his eventual banishment by Gahrian. Cast out from the celestial realms, Matiodox's fall from grace turned him into a cautionary tale of the dangers inherent in unchecked vanity. This banishment marked his transformation into the vice of vanity, shaping him into a pivotal figure in the pantheon of Vices of Excess.
