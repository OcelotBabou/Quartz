**Description:** 
Scurriers are the nimble scouts and foragers of Alberine society, renowned for their agility and resourcefulness. With keen senses and quick reflexes, they excel at navigating the dense foliage of the jungle, uncovering hidden secrets, and gathering essential resources for their communities. Scurriers are adept at climbing trees, leaping from branch to branch with ease, and traversing the tangled undergrowth with silent grace. They are the eyes and ears of their communities, always vigilant and alert to potential threats or opportunities.
