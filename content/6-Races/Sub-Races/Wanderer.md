**ASI:** +1 Cha

**Sword for Hire**: You gain proficiency in all martial weapons, medium armour, and shields. Additionally, you gain proficiency in either persuasion or intimidation checks, and earn additional commissions for any guild related tasks. Further, thanks to your numerous encounters and experience defending yourself in your wandering, you can use your reaction to add your Cha modifier to your AC once per day against an attack that would otherwise hit. The decision is made after the hit is confirmed to have hit, but before the hit score is revealed. Recharges on a long rest.

**Description**
The Wanderer Cia'an are a nomadic and resilient subrace, forced to leave behind their ancestral homeland for reasons known only to themselves. Whether exiled, banished, or simply seeking to escape the confines of their tribe, they have embarked on journeys that have taken them far from the familiar comforts of home.

Adaptable and resourceful, Wanderer Cia'an are known for their skill at arms and their unwavering resilience in the face of adversity. They have honed their abilities as warriors and hunters to perfection, relying on their instincts and their wits to survive in a world that can be as dangerous as it is unforgiving.

Despite their solitary existence, Wanderer Cia'an are highly sought after for their renowned skill and expertise. Many find work as sell swords and bodyguards, offering their services to the highest bidder in exchange for coin and camaraderie. Others seek out more noble pursuits, using their talents to protect the innocent and uphold the principles of justice and honour.

Yet beneath their hardened exterior lies a deep sense of longing and yearning, a desire to find a place where they truly belong. Many Wanderer Cia'an wander the world in search of a way to fill the void left by their exile, seeking solace in the company of kindred spirits and the thrill of adventure.

For some, the road is a lonely and arduous one, fraught with danger and uncertainty. But for others, it is a journey of discovery and redemption, a chance to forge new bonds and find purpose in a world that is vast and boundless.

Though they may walk paths far from home, the spirit of the Wanderer Cia'an remains unbroken. They are the children of the wild and the guardians of their own destiny, destined to carve out their own place in the world and leave their mark upon its history.
