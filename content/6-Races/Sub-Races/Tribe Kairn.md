**Description:**
The Kairn Harpies, also known as mountain harpies, are the most common and widespread of their kind, with two main clans inhabiting the rugged [[Ridgeback Mountains]] and the towering peaks of the [[Talam Mountains]]. Smaller clans can also be found scattered throughout the region, each staking their claim to the craggy landscapes they call home.

Taller and hardier than their counterparts, the Kairn Harpies have adapted to thrive amidst the harsh winds and unforgiving terrain of the mountains. Their plumage reflects the colours of their surroundings, blending seamlessly with the rocky outcrops and snow-capped peaks that dominate their homeland.

Incredibly territorial by nature, the Kairn Harpies are among the most war-inclined of their kind, fiercely defending their territories from intruders with tooth and claw. Many among them travel as mercenaries, offering their services as vanguards and frontline fighters to the highest bidder.

Despite their warlike tendencies, the Kairn Harpies are not without their virtues. They possess a strong sense of honour and loyalty, and once their trust is earned, they are steadfast allies and formidable foes alike. Their ties to other races run deep, particularly across Siar Morrin and the Kair'Thear region, where they are the most intertwined with other cultures and civilizations.

As the most common harpy across the region, the Kairn Harpies play a vital role in the politics and power struggles of the region. Their strength and prowess in battle make them valuable assets to those who can afford their services, while their keen intellect and strategic acumen ensure that they are never far from the centre of attention.

In a world torn apart by conflict and ambition, the Kairn Harpies stand as a testament to the enduring resilience of their kind. With their indomitable spirit and unwavering determination, they are ready to face whatever challenges the future may hold, carving out their own destiny amidst the towering peaks and craggy valleys of their mountainous homeland.
