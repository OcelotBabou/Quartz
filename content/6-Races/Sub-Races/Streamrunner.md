**Description:**
Streamrunners are the swift and agile fishermen and merchants of Alberine society, with an affinity for water matched only by their boundless energy. They make their homes along the rivers and streams that wind their way through the heart of the jungle, using their skills as fishermen to provide sustenance for their communities and trading their bountiful harvests with neighbouring settlements. Streamrunners are expert swimmers, with webbed hands and feet that allow them to move effortlessly through the water. They are the lifeblood of their communities, bridging the gap between land and water and ensuring the prosperity of their kin.
