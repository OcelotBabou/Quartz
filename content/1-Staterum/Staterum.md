In the annals of time, the saga of Staterum unfolds, its origins shrouded in the mists of antiquity, where myth and reality intertwine like the roots of ancient trees. At the dawn of creation, amidst the cosmic tapestry, Statera, the divine arbiter of balance, reigned supreme over the celestial realm. With her four sons - Gahrian, embodiment of radiant light and excess; Alache, harbinger of shadowy depths and void; Eris, the enforcer of law's immutable decree; and Dorna, the capricious muse of chaos - she wove the fabric of existence itself.

Under Statera's celestial guidance, the Elemental Envoys, masters of primordial forces, were compelled to bend their will to her divine mandate. Thus, the world of Staterum was forged in homage to its divine progenitor, a testament to the harmony of cosmic design. In concert with her celestial consort, Aruinbe, Statera sired a new pantheon of deities, ushering in an era of divine progeny. Driven by a restless yearning for dynamic existence, Statera, bestowed the gift of life upon the barren lands of Staterum, birthing the myriad races that now traverse its storied realms.

Yet, peace is rarely long lived, and soon death itself found itâ€™s way to Staterum, doggedly bestowing its presence of the numerous races of Staterum. The intrusion of mortality shattered the immortal serenity of the races, and the once sheltered humans now set out to establish their place in the vast world. It was in this crucible of mortal strife that humanity found its nascent genesis, led by the visionary Biran and his stalwart kin, Mercio, Ratura and Vilcren.

In the halcyon days that followed, humanity flourished, their settlements sprawling across the verdant expanse of Staterum. But the tempest of chaos loomed on the horizon, heralded by the tragic fall of Eolas, the Goddess of knowledge, to the ever-present temptation presented by the demons of excess. The ensuing cataclysm unleashed the fury of war upon the land, as whole nations clashed in a symphony of devastation and despair.

From the ashes of conflict arose a new epoch, characterized by the ascendance of arcane arts and technological marvels. Yet, in their hubris, mortals sought to grasp the very fabric of reality itself, culminating in the hubristic folly of Raxenos, whose reckless pursuit of power unleashed a cataclysmic maelstrom that rent the heavens asunder.

As the world teetered on the brink of oblivion, the divine pantheon, feeling betrayed by the mortal folly, withdrew to distant realms, leaving Staterum to languish in the suffocating embrace of darkness. For a century, the land lay desolate, haunted by the spectre of annihilation, until by means unknown the infernal portals were sealed and the demonic hordes were banished back to their infernal abyss.

This is but one, albeit commonly accepted, account of the history of Staterum. Time, that ever-shifting tapestry weaves tales both grand and subtle, moulding truths into myriad shapes. In the hallowed halls of Staterum's lore, whispers of divergent chronicles linger, each bearing the imprint of its teller's bias and perspective. Thus, in the labyrinth of myth and memory, it is imperative to tread with cautious reverence, for rare is it indeed to uncover the elusive veil of absolute truth amidst the enigmatic echoes of the past.
