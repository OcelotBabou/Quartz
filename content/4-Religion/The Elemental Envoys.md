### 1. **Overview**

Although commonly referred to as a collective, the Elemental Envoys are comprised of two distinct groups: the Primordials and the Elemental Envoys. These beings represent the fundamental energies that compose the universe, each group serving a unique purpose in the maintenance and interaction of elemental powers within the universe.

The Primordials are the ancient embodiments of the elemental forces—Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. These gods do not merely represent their respective elements; they _are_ the very essence of these forces. Each Primordial rules over one of the four elemental planes of existence, parallel dimensions that embody the purest form of their respective elements.

The Elemental Envoys are the progeny of the Primordial Elementals, created to act as intermediaries between the elemental planes and the mortal world of Statera. Each envoy inherits aspects of their parent's power but is tasked with a mission to bring these elemental gifts to the lands of Staterum.

### 3. **Perspectives**

**[[Elementum Arcanum]]**
The Elementum Arcanum, a deeply knowledgeable and venerable society of elemental magic practitioners, holds a profound understanding of the origins and roles of the Elemental Envoys. According to their teachings and extensive research, the universe's inception is closely tied to the emergence of the Primordials, who were born from the raw, chaotic energies of the cosmos during its earliest moments.

The Primordials —entities of immense power and elemental purity—formed over inconceivable spans of time. As these elemental forces gradually gained sentience, they became the architects of the world known as Staterum. It was the harmonious convergence of the elemental powers in the creation of Staterum that led to the formation of Statera, a goddess born from the perfect balance of their combined energies.

Content with their collective creation, the Primordials created their own elemental planes—separate dimensions where they could retreat yet continue to oversee Staterum. Recognizing the need for ongoing stewardship on Staterum, each Primordial left behind several of their children—the Elemental Envoys. These Envoys are tasked with a sacred duty: to assist Statera in maintaining the elemental balance that is vital for Staterum's stability and prosperity.

**[[Church of Statera]]**
The Primordials are the creations of Statera, crafted from the raw, chaotic energies of the universe during its formative phases. Statera, in her wisdom and foresight, imbued these energies with life, giving rise to the Primordials. Statera, then issued the Primordials the mighty task of creation Staterum alongside her. 

In gratitude for their services, Statera bestowed upon each of them dominion over their own elemental planes. These planes were realms where each elemental could rule supremely, allowing them to exist in a state of purity and power, aligned with their elemental nature. However, Statera requested that each elemental contribute a child to maintain the elemental balance on Staterum, each Primordial, eager to please their creator, offered not one but several children. These offspring, known as the Elemental Envoys, were tasked with extending the influence and balance of their respective elements within the mortal world of Staterum.

**[[Dahri Empire]]**
In the Dahri Empire the concept of Elemental Envoys and Primordials is met with skepticism. The Dahri view these entities as anthropomorphic manifestations of natural phenomena, created by less scientifically advanced societies to explain the complexities of the natural world.

To the scholars and citizens of the Dahri Empire, the idea that elemental forces are governed by divine beings is seen as an outdated and simplistic approach. They argue that such beliefs stem from a time when humanity lacked the scientific knowledge to properly investigate and understand the natural mechanisms at work. In their view, attributing personality and intent to elements like fire, water, air, and earth is merely a way to bring comfort to those who find the randomness of nature intimidating.
