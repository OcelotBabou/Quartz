### 1. **Overview**

The Vices are dark figures representing the dual nature of mortal weaknesses and excesses. They are categorized into two distinct groups—Excess and Void—each embodying extreme aspects of mortal characteristics and emotions. 

The Vices of Excess represent the overindulgence or hyperbolic expression of human traits that, in moderation, might be considered normal or even virtuous. Contrasting with Excess, the Vices of Void are manifestations of the absence or deficiency of certain qualities that are essential for a balanced existence. 

Despite varying beliefs and the degree of reverence towards different deities in Statera, the influence of the Vices is universally acknowledged. They are seen at best as representations of humanities worst traits, at worst demonic forces bent on the destruction of Staterum.

### 3. **Perspectives**

**[[The Church of Statera]]**
The Vices are the most profound and dangerous threats ever encountered by Staterum. These entities are not merely symbolic representations of moral and emotional extremes but are the very real, malevolent forces actively seeking to undermine the harmony and balance established by Statera.

The Vices of Excess are demons, embodying the overindulgence of mortal desires and emotions. They tempt and corrupt individuals by pushing them towards extreme behaviors that lead to chaos and destruction. Each Vice of Excess actively seeks to inflate human egos, desires, and emotions to destructive levels, driving individuals away from the path of balance that Statera champions.

The Vices of Void are devils, employing trickery and deception to strip humans of their inherent virtues. They create vacuums in the human spirit, sowing doubt, fear, and despair, and robbing individuals of the will and strength needed to pursue a virtuous life. Their tactics are subtle compared to the brashness of the Excess, making them insidious threats that erode moral foundations from within.

During the Age of Discord ([[AoD]]), the Vices nearly succeeded in their quest to destroy Staterum. It was only through Statera's immense sacrifice that their advance was halted. Statera, in her ultimate act of devotion to her creation, managed to contain the Vices, preventing them from directly interacting with the mortal world. However, this sacrifice came at the cost of her mortal form. As such Statera now resides in an ascended plane, carefully watching over Staterum. 

[[Elves]]
The Vices were once divine beings, initially serving as stewards under [[Gahrian]] and [[Alache]]. This stewardship was based on the balance and harmony that the brothers themselves maintained, with each Vice tasked with managing specific aspects of the world's moral and emotional fabric. The competitive nature of the Vices, however, stood in stark contrast to the cooperative relationship between Gahrian and Alache. Over time, this competitiveness drove the Vices to strive increasingly to outdo each other, pushing their respective domains of excess and void to more extreme manifestations. In their efforts to surpass one another, they began to destabilize the very balance that their creators had worked so diligently to uphold.

The escalating actions of the Vices eventually forced Gahrian and Alache to take drastic measures. Viewing the unchecked extremities of the Vices as a direct threat to the equilibrium of the world, the brothers made the painful decision to banish the Vices to separate realms. Sequestered in their respective realms, the Vices' anger and resentment toward their former masters festered. Cut off from the world they once influenced, these fallen stewards transformed their thwarted ambitions into a vengeful desire. Their new goal became the corruption of the world that Gahrian and Alache had so carefully balanced. 

**[[Riben]]**
For the people of Riben the Vices are seen purely as symbolic representations of human nature's darker aspects. The concept of the Vices serves as a framework for moral education, where each Vice illustrates the consequences of moral excess or deficiency. 

To outsiders, the dismissal of the Vices as real threats—especially in light of the devastating impact of the AoD—is perplexing. However, the ruling Riben aristocrats explains this historical period through a strictly non-supernatural lens. They attribute the chaos and destruction traditionally ascribed to the Vices to natural disasters, coupled with opportunistic raiding from the Siar'Morrin zealots. They believe the people of Siar'Morrin took advantage of the chaos caused by natural disasters to  hide their pillaging behind the guise of demonic forces. Over time their actions and the influence of the extreme, but natural, disasters have been mythologized.
