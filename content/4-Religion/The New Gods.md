### 1. **Overview**

In Statera, the New Gods stand as vibrant symbols of the nuanced aspects of civilization and the evolving practices of mortal races. Unlike the more foundational deities, the New Gods are closely tied to more specialized domains. Their realms extend into every corner of mortal experience, from the arts and sciences to daily practices and professions. This specialization has led to numerous unique and niche religious practices and traditions. 

The power and influence of the New Gods vary greatly among them, dependent on the extent of their worship and the relevance of their domains to current societal needs. Some, like [[Mercio]] and [[Vilcren]], may wield substantial influence and thus power, in economically driven or agriculturally rich regions. While the Goddess [[Ludara]] has largely been forgotten and diminished since the Age of Darkness ([[AoD]]).

### 3. **Perspectives**

**[[The Ascended Church]]**
Even amongst those that are devote to the New Gods, it is very rare to find someone that worships all of them, or seem them as equals. The Ascended Church exemplifies this, upholding the supremacy of the Ascended Gods—Vilcren, Mercio, and Ratura—as the true exemplars of divine influence and power.

The Ascended Church regards some of the other New Gods, such as Cazium or Alber, with a degree of skepticism. To them, figures like Cazium, and Alber, represent localized or less civilized attempts to deify former tribal leaders or heroes. These figures are often dismissed as "pseudo-gods," revered perhaps out of tradition or cultural loyalty but lacking the universal significance and divine essence that characterize the Ascended Gods.

While the Ascended Church promotes the worship of Vilcren, Mercio, and Ratura above all, it acknowledges that as the church expands into new regions, many converts bring with them varying degrees of attachment to other New Gods. These deities may still hold importance in their daily lives, particularly in regions where specific practices or environments make such gods relevant. However, to fully integrate into The Ascended Church, adherents are encouraged to recognize the superiority of the Ascended Gods.

**[[Windswept Marches]]**
In regions such as the Windswept Marches, there is a particular reverence for select groupings of the New Gods. For the Windswept Marches, a region profoundly influenced by the stark transitions and harsh impacts of changing seasons, the worship of the seasonal goddesses—Mavera, Estera, Tunera, and Invera—is particularly prominent. 

While the seasonal goddesses receive widespread reverence across the Windswept Marches, additional worship practices vary among different subgroups within the region, often influenced by profession, ancestry, or local traditions. Demonstrating the vast variety of cultural practices around the New Gods. 

**The Rieroan Sentinels**
The Rieroan Sentinels are a revered group of soldiers stationed along the formidable Paleomyna Wall. For The Rieroan Sentinels, Riero is not just a patron but the central figure of their faith and daily lives. Their dedication to him is profound, transcending the typical reverence seen in other military groups. This singular devotion means that while they respect the pantheon of Old Gods traditional to Siar'Morrin, their focus remains almost exclusively on Riero. This is not out of disrespect for other deities but a reflection of their belief that Riero’s teachings and virtues are most pertinent to their survival and role as guardians. 

**[[Riben]]**
In Riben the reverence of the New Gods as seen in other parts of Statera is met with ridicule. The populace in Riben views the deification of historical figures as an irrational elevation of what are, in their eyes, merely exceptional humans whose deeds have been overly romanticized through the ages. 

The idea that individuals like Vilcren, Mercio, or Ratura were anything more than skilled mortals who made notable contributions to society is widely regarded as absurd. They acknowledge that while some of these figures might have been great warriors, brilliant innovators, or influential leaders, the notion of their divinity is rejected as an exaggeration perpetuated by those who misunderstand the natural progression of cultural development.

Recently, the government of Riben has moved from mere passive dismissal to active suppression of discussions surrounding the New Gods and any form of deity worship. The enforcement of secular principles has led to the prohibition of public religious gatherings and the removal of religious symbols from public spaces.
